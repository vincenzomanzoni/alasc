# Introduction #

ALASC acronym stay for _A Logo (to) ActionScript Compiler_. It's the product of an academic course about formal languages and compilers.

# Details #

ALASC project purposes are_:
  * Create a compiler that reads a program written in a subset of Logo istructions and converts it in an ActionScript flash script, that draws the same figure.
  * Experiment the usage of JavaCC library_

## The test application ##
Below a diagram of our test application, which uses ALASC to compile a Logo program in a ActionScript language, then uses [MTASC](http://code.google.com/p/alasc/wiki/UsareMTASC) compiler to generate a SWF file, that we can see inside a web browser with Flash plugin.
